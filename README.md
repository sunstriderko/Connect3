# Connect3

This is a quick project using WPF .NET Core.

Connect3 is a Tic Tac Toe - type application which I used to train working with WPF application. It is a one-window app
where 2 players can play head-to-head match in Tic Tac Toe. If there is no human-like opponent, you can play vs an AI.
Application also saves history of turns to a text file so the user can look at the game turn-by-turn.

This application will work on any PC which supports .NET Core.
